# README

This is my random set of tools.

## database_backup.sh

This is my database backup script that I use for my weblog.

## generate_rails_doc.sh

This is a script that generates Rails API in HTML format.

## screencapture.sh

This script takes a screenshots and saves it to Dropbox.

## gource2mp4.sh

This script uses Gource to generate a PPM video stream from source control 
log (Git, Mercurial, etc) and save the video stream to MPEG4 format.

This script is intended to take output from [TFSConverter](http://github.com/mikeashley/TFSConverter) by mikeashley.

I actually have not tested this script with Git or Mercurial based 
projects.
